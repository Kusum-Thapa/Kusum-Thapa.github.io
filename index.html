						<h3>Return To Tech</h3>
						 <p>I am originally from Nepal, a developing country where there was only limited access to technology when I was a child. I was always fascinated with technology specially computers and curious how we could use it to better our lives. With growing curiosity and interest in IT sector I worked towards becoming software developer. After graduating in Computing Science degree and few years of experience  working in software development field, I successfully built my career as a software consultant. I have a strong passion on programming and enjoy learning new technologies. Despite a long career break in programming, I am determined and working hard to resume my software developer career and take up this challenge.</p>
                         <p>I strongly believe with growth mindset approach, <em> Return To Tech</em> program will give me an opportunity to gain back my confidence, develop my technical knowledge and provide me support to rebuild my career in tech.</p>
